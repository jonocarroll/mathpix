Description: Given an image of a formula (typeset or handwritten) this package
    provides calls to the 'Mathpix' service to produce the 'LaTeX' code which should
    generate that image, and pastes it into a (e.g. an 'rmarkdown') document. 
    See <https://docs.mathpix.com/> for full details. 'Mathpix' is an external service 
    and use of the API is subject to their terms and conditions.
